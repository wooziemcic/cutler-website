          <h2>Origins and specialization</h2>
          <p>
            Cutler’s roots trace back to work as a family office for an independent investing entrepreneur.
            Over time, that orientation evolved into a focused firm with long-standing expertise in growth and income investing using specific types of securities.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have historically spent significant time in areas that can be underfollowed or operationally “too small” for global firms to prioritize, including REITs, convertible securities, and community bank stocks.
            The goal is not novelty. The goal is disciplined underwriting in places where careful work can matter.
          </p>

          <h2>Wealth management approach</h2>
          <p>
            We believe wealth management should be more than a generic model portfolio.
            Planning is most useful when it connects capital to what a client is trying to accomplish over time.
            We aim to build plans and portfolios that are aligned to purpose, constraints, and the realities of risk.
