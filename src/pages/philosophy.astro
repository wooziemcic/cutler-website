          Our goal is to be consistent: in how we evaluate risk, how we underwrite opportunities, and how we communicate through uncertainty.

          <h2>How we define risk</h2>
          <p>
            We define risk as the probability of permanent impairment of capital. Day-to-day price movement can be uncomfortable,
            but it is not the same thing as losing intrinsic value. Our process emphasizes understanding downside scenarios,
            balance-sheet resilience, and liquidity—particularly in smaller or less-followed markets.
          </p>

            <p>
              “Volatility is the price you pay for long-term returns. Permanent loss is what we work to avoid.”
            </p>

          <h2>Why we focus on inefficient markets</h2>
          <p>
            We concentrate on segments where research effort can matter more than scale—areas that are often underfollowed,
            complex, or fragmented. In these markets, patient capital and careful underwriting can create an advantage.

            <h3>Process over prediction</h3>
            <p>
              We do not build portfolios around short-term forecasts. We focus on underwriting, valuation,
              and resilience under a range of outcomes.

            <h3>Alignment and stewardship</h3>
            <p>
              We approach client capital with a stewardship mindset—prioritizing long-term outcomes
              over short-term optics.

            <h3>Calm through volatility</h3>
            <p>
              Markets can be emotional. We aim to be steady: communicate clearly, reassess facts,
              and avoid reactive decision-making.
