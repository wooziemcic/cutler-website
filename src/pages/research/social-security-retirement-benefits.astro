          <p>
            Social Security was originally intended to provide older Americans with continuing income after retirement.
            Today, though the scope of Social Security has been widened to include survivor, disability, and other benefits,
            retirement benefits are still the cornerstone of the program.
          </p>

          <h2 id="qualify">How do you qualify for retirement benefits?</h2>
          <p>
            When you work and pay Social Security taxes (FICA on some pay stubs), you earn Social Security credits.
            You can earn up to 4 credits each year. You generally need 40 credits (10 years of work) to be eligible for
            retirement benefits.
          </p>

          <h2 id="how-much">How much will your retirement benefit be?</h2>
          <p>
            Your retirement benefit is based on your average earnings over your working career. Higher lifetime earnings
            result in higher benefits, so if you have some years of no earnings or low earnings, your benefit amount may be
            lower than if you had worked steadily.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your age at the time you start receiving benefits also affects your benefit amount. Although you can retire early
            at age 62, the longer you wait to retire (up to age 70), the higher your retirement benefit.
          </p>

          <div class="callout">
            <p class="callout-title">Practical note</p>
            <p>
              You can estimate future benefits by creating a <strong>my Social Security</strong> account at <strong>ssa.gov</strong>
              to view your Social Security Statement and earnings history. This is often the fastest way to sanity-check assumptions.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="fra">Retiring at full retirement age</h2>
          <p>Your full retirement age depends on the year in which you were born:</p>

          <div class="table-wrap" role="region" aria-label="Full retirement age table">
            <table class="table">
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>If you were born in</th>
                  <th>Your full retirement age is</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr><td>1943–1954</td><td>66</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1955</td><td>66 and 2 months</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1956</td><td>66 and 4 months</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1957</td><td>66 and 6 months</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1958</td><td>66 and 8 months</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1959</td><td>66 and 10 months</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1960 and later</td><td>67</td></tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>

          <p class="small muted">
            Tip: If you were born on January 1 of any year, refer to the previous year to determine your full retirement age.
          </p>

          <h2 id="early">Retiring early will reduce your benefit</h2>
          <p>
            You can begin receiving Social Security benefits before your full retirement age, as early as age 62.
            However, if you retire early, your Social Security benefit will be less than if you wait until your full retirement age.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reduction is permanent — you won’t be eligible for a benefit increase once you reach full retirement age.
            Even though your monthly benefit will be less, you might receive the same or more total lifetime benefits
            if you collect over a longer period of time.
          </p>

          <h2 id="delay">Delaying retirement will increase your benefit</h2>
          <p>
            For each month you delay receiving Social Security retirement benefits past your full retirement age,
            your benefit increases by a certain percentage (depending on birth year), up until age 70.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working past full retirement age may also help because higher earning years can replace lower earning years
            in your record — potentially raising your benefit.
          </p>

          <h2 id="work">Working may affect your retirement benefit</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Under full retirement age:</strong> $1 in benefits deducted for every $2 earned above the annual limit</li>
            <li><strong>Year you reach full retirement age:</strong> $1 deducted for every $3 earned above the (higher) annual limit until the month you reach FRA</li>
            <li><strong>After full retirement age:</strong> You can earn without reducing benefits</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="family">Retirement benefits for qualified family members</h2>
          <p>
            Even if your spouse has never worked outside your home or in a job covered by Social Security, he or she may be eligible
            for spousal benefits based on your earnings record. Other members of your family may also be eligible.
          </p>

          <h2 id="apply">How do you apply?</h2>
          <p>
            The SSA recommends applying three months before you want benefits to start. You can apply online, by phone, or at a local SSA office.
